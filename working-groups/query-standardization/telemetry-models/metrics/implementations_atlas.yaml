    description: >
      A key/value map of strings describing the time series. The metric name is _not_ a top level 
      field, rather it is included in the map with the key `name`.
    specification:
      - Only characters in the set `-._A-Za-z0-9^~` are allowed. Characters outside the set are replaced with `_`.
      - A `name` key is required with a value from 2 to 255 characters in length.
      - Keys must be from 2 to 60 characters in length.
      - Values must be from 1 to 120 characters in length.
      - Null keys or values are not allowed.
      - Duplicate keys are not allowed.
      - Keys starting with `atlas.`, `nf.` and `statistic` are reserved for internal use.
      - >
        Generally, users may include 18 custom tags for a metric, enforced by data collectors. Instrumentation 
        libraries typically add the `name` and `statistic` but may also include other tags depending on the 
        metric type.
  - attribute: timestamp
    description: >
      Timestamps are always Unix Epoch milliseconds in 64 bit signed integer format. Atlas metrics are pushed 
      from clients to the Atlas backend on a regular reporting interval. The timestamp is the end of the 
      reporting interval with the interval start being inclusive and the end exclusive.

      Reports the rate at which an operation occurs during a reporting interval. Records increments as a
      monotonic counter in the library or sidecar but reports the delta between the current and previous
      reporting intervals divided by the number of seconds in the interval to produce a rate of increments
      per second.

      Measures the latency of an operation and `spectator_timer` time series as well as non-cumulative bucketed
      histogram time series to enable computing percentiles at query time. Only buckets with values incremented
      within a reporting interval are reported.
      Bucket boundaries are fixed though users can explicitly omit some buckets.
    attributes:
      identifier:

          The sum, max, and sum of squares are in seconds. The count is the number of measurements divided by 
          seconds in the interval. Percentile buckets are the count for that bucket divided by the total seconds
          in the interval.
