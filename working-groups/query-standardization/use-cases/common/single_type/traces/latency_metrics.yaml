title: Trace Latency Metrics

description: >
  Tracing measure operation latencies and common operation is to convert the span
  latencies into time series metrics. These aggregations can then re-use existing 
  metrics infrastructure (alerting systems, dashboards, etc).
  Query results may also include exemplars for drilling into details.

inputs:
  - trace spans

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Values may be bucketed into a heatmap view such as that offered by Honeycomb.
      Percentiles, average and max latencies may also be extracted for line graphs.

examples:
  - language: DQL
    query: >
      fetch spans 
      | summarize avg(duration) , by:{ bin(timestamp, 30s),service.name}
